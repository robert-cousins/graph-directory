## Why this exists

This is a parking lot for decisions that should not be made accidentally during implementation.

## Key decisions

Planned phases (high-level):

### Phase 3: Consolidation + Legacy Removal
- Remove or redirect legacy routes
- Ensure only new query contracts are used
- Clean up deprecated types/services once confirmed unused

### Phase 4: Submission + Ownership
- Business submission flow
- Ownership model (likely token-based initially)
- Status transitions: draft → pending_review → published
- Minimal moderation workflow

### Phase 5: SEO Surfaces + Internal Linking
- Schema.org markup
- Entity landing pages
- Systematic content expansion (templated but data-grounded)
- Strong internal link graph

### Phase 6: Trust + Scale
- Reviews (with abuse controls)
- Better geo (hierarchy/radius)
- Optional auth
- Audit logs

Open questions:
- Should we introduce “trade” as a first-class entity now, or at first expansion beyond plumbers?
- Do we want suburb hierarchies (region/locality) before or after multi-trade?
- What ownership model is best before authentication exists?
- How should verification evidence be stored (file uploads vs manual checks only)?
